Lunabot Controller:

This is the controller software developed for the Montana M.U.L.E. project.
This project was a capstone project for a multi disipline team consisting of
3 electrical engineers, 4 mechanical engineers/tech and 1 computer science/engineer
majors.

Info on the compition can be found at:

The Montana M.U.L.E. won this national robotic event May 28, 2010

To run this software you need the following dependencies:
* python
* pyGame
* pyQT

On the server you need a running instance of:
* ser2net

Improvements needed:
* Improve network layer to fixed broken pipe errors
* Improve GUI so that timer funtion works and stdout is displayed in text feild
* Add menus so that IP addresses and Ports don't need to be hard codded

Please keep in mind that I wrote this to only be used by me to control the robot,
therefor the interface is not the most intuitive. This was also created durring an
extremely busy semester where I was takeing 19 credits.
